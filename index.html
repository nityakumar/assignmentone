                Feminism is not a radical movement or a fringe <br>movement or an embarrassment or a fraud.<br> Feminism is simple. The "patriarchy" does "exist."<br> To identify as a feminist is to acknowledge that<br> women are people, and, as such, women deserve<br> the same social, economic, and political rights<br> and opportunities as other styles of people<br> (i.e., men-people). To be a feminist is also to<br> acknowledge that the world is not, currently,<br> a fair and just and safe place for women <br>to exist. Because it is not. Obviously (see: <br>everything ever). To deny these things makes <br>you,at worst, a bad person who hates women<br>, including but not limited to: Sarah Michelle<br> Gellar, Jennifer Garner, Jennifer Aniston,<br> Jennifer Lopez, your mother, Jennifer Lopez's <br>mother, Jennifer Garner's Aunt Marcy, Michelle <br>Obama, Ellen DeGeneres, Cher, Julie Andrews,<br> Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney<br> Kardashian, Kraken Kardashian, Karphone <br>Kardashian, Kickball Kardashian, Kornkob <br>Kardashian, and THE VIRGIN FUCKING MARY.<br><br>

                After World War II, women started to be like, 'Oh!<br> Maybe I can get a Job and tell my husband to<br> stop raping me!' They began taking on subtler <br>forms of sexism and misogynyâ€“things that<br>might not be legally mandated (like voting<br> rights) but were fucking up women's lives none-<br>theless. These women would become the sec-<br>ond-wavers. In 1963. Betty Friedman made every<br>one go crazy by suggesting that the nuclear family
                 <br> might be a crock of shit that stifled wom-<br>en's potential and made them unhappy. Then<br>soooo many things happened!!! Birth control<br>pills. Illegalization of marital rape, The Equal <br> Rights Amendment did not pass. Women <br> continued to fight. because women are awesome. <br><br>
